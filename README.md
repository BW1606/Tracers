# Tracers
Repository for a program to integrate lagrangian tracer particles into astrophysical hydro simulations i have developed during my master thesis - together with a few example nucleosynthesis analysis notebooks when using the tracers to run the nuclear reaction network WinNet. (Rough first version,  more polished soon after my thesis)
